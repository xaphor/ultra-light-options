A lightweight, performance-focused WooCommerce plugin for adding custom product options with conditional logic and advanced pricing (Tiered, Formula, Fixed).

== Description ==

Ultra-Light Product Options is built for WooCommerce store owners who need powerful custom product options without the performance bloat or annual subscription fees of premium plugins.

Unlike many competitors who lock essential features like conditional logic, tiered pricing, and formula-based calculations behind a paywall, Ultra-Light Options provides these features 100% free and open-source.

= Key Features =
* **Advanced Pricing Types**: Flat price, quantity-based, tiered/volume pricing, formulas, and field-value based pricing.
* **Conditional Logic**: Show or hide fields based on other field selections or product variations.
* **Sortable Field Builder**: An intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for building complex product forms.
* **Tiered/Volume Pricing**: Easily setup quantity-based discounts with a visual tier builder and minimum price floors.
* **Variation Support**: Assign fields to specific product variations or across entire categories.
* **Zero Layout Shift (ZLS)**: Optimized CSS ensures your product pages don't jump during load.
* **High Performance**: Vanilla JS only. No jQuery, no bloat, and minimal database footprint.
* **GMC Compliant**: Properly formatted structured data for Google Merchant Center compatibility.

= Why Choose Ultra-Light? =
Most "free" product addon plugins are just marketing for their pro versions. Ultra-Light was built with a different philosophy: performance first, and no artificial limitations on features.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the **WooCommerce -> Product Options** menu to configure your option groups.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with variations? =
Yes! You can set fields to only show for specific product variations using the conditional logic rules.
